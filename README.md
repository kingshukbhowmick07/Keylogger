# Keylogger 
# Language used : Python

A keylogger is a type of malicious software (malware) that is designed to record every keystroke made on a computer or mobile device. This can include sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal or confidential data.

Keyloggers can be installed on a device through various methods, including phishing emails, fake software downloads, and infected websites. Once installed, the keylogger runs in the background and captures all keyboard input, which is then transmitted to the attacker who can use the information for nefarious purposes.

Keyloggers can be difficult to detect and remove, and it is important to regularly update your antivirus and malware protection software to protect against these threats. It is also important to practice safe browsing habits, such as avoiding suspicious links and downloads and using strong passwords, to minimize the risk of falling victim to a keylogger attack.
